        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This site was made as a school project using Java, JPA, EclipseLink, MySQL and JSP Servlets with help from the book <a href=""https://www.murach.com/shop/murach-s-java-servlets-and-jsp-3rd-edition-detail">'Murachâ€™s Java Servlets and JSP (3rd Edition)'</a>.  It was inspired by <a href="http://www.reddit.com">reddit</a> from whom I borrowed the algorithm for the 'Hot' page and by <a href="http://www.bypeople.com/">ByPeople</a>, a great place to find user-submitted developer resources.  The source is available on <a href="https://github.com/andrewlouie">my GitHub</a>. I hope you find this site helpful and share it with your friends.  If people are using it, it will continue to grow and improve.  Thanks for visiting.</p>
